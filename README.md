# bankruptcy

* run 'python data_analyzer.py' from this directory for the results below (this almost certainly does not work anymore)
* run 'python __main__.py' or 'python ../bankruptcy' from /bankruptcy to gather PUMA / county etc data (for all years that you provide in the files section)
- Data is collected to puma-output.csv
* run 'python learn.py' to test a prediction based on puma-output.csv

## How-To

### Set up more years

* Always name files starting with their year

#### County Bankruptcy Data

- Data for bankruptcies by county and year can be found here: https://www.uscourts.gov/report-name/bankruptcy-filings?tn=&pt=All&t=534&m%5Bvalue%5D%5Bmonth%5D=&y%5Bvalue%5D%5Byear%5D=2018
    - Select bankruptcy from the topic drop-down menu and the year that you want
    - Look for the link for "U.S. Bankruptcy Courts - Business and Nonbusiness Cases Filed, by Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, District, and County‚Äù
    - The PDF will give you a pretty view, but you need the csv file
    - Click on the link then download the CSV
    - Edit the CSV thus:
        - Copy the Circ/Dist and County column to column A
        - Copy the county code column into column B
        - Copy the total non business bankruptcies column to column C
        - Delete all other data
        - Unmerge all cells
        - Remove data from the top few columns (can accept any number of leading blank rows)

## Results

Taking into account (in order of predictive power) divorce(1), age(2), health insurance(3), and education(4), with 2013 - 2018 census, ACS, and bankruptcy data, my model is able to predict bankrupcty rate of a PUMA on average to within 111 people on average per 100,000 (vs 115 when predicting with the mean), is 33% off from the true value on average (vs 34%), and out predicts the mean 55.5% of the time (R^2: 0.043)

1) Percent of a PUMA'S population that is currently divorced (rather than single, widowed, etc)
    - min: 3%
    - max: 23%
    - Higher divorce rate is correlated with higher bankruptcy (R^2 - .030)
2) Percent of a PUMA's population that is between the ages of 35 and 54
    - min: 5%
    - max: 34%
    - This rate is correlated with higher bankruptcy (R^2 - .023)
3) Percent of a PUMA's population that has health insurance
    - min: 45%
    - max: 99%
    - This rate is inversely related with higher bankruptcy (R^2 - .015)
4) Percent of a PUMA's population that has just a high school degree of some college
    - min: 12%
    - max: 64%
    - This rate is correlated with higher bankruptcy (R^2 - .010)
