# bankruptcy

run 'python data_analyzer.py' from this directory for the results below
run 'python data_collector.py' to gather PUMA / county etc data (incomplete)
- Data is collected to puma-output.csv
run 'python learn.py' to test a prediction based on puma-output.csv

## How-To

### Set up more years

* Always name files starting with their year

#### County Bankruptcy Data

- Data for bankruptcies by county and year can be found here: https://www.uscourts.gov/report-name/bankruptcy-filings?tn=&pt=All&t=534&m%5Bvalue%5D%5Bmonth%5D=&y%5Bvalue%5D%5Byear%5D=2018
    - Select bankruptcy from the topic drop-down menu and the year that you want
    - Look for the link for "U.S. Bankruptcy Courts - Business and Nonbusiness Cases Filed, by Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, District, and County‚Äù
    - The PDF will give you a pretty view, but you need the csv file
    - Click on the link then download the CSV
    - Edit the CSV thus:
        - Copy the Circ/Dist and County column to column A
        - Copy the county code column into column B
        - Copy the total non business bankruptcies column to column C
        - Delete all other data
        - Unmerge all cells
        - Remove data from the top few columns (can accept any number of leading blank rows)
