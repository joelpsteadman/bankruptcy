# bankruptcy

run 'python data_analyzer.py' from this directory for the results below
run 'python data_collector.py' to gather PUMA / county etc data (incomplete)
- Data is collected to puma-output.csv
run 'python learn.py' to test a prediction based on puma-output.csv

## How-To

### Set up more years

* Always name files starting with their year

#### County Bankruptcy Data

- Data for bankruptcies by county and year can be found here: https://www.uscourts.gov/report-name/bankruptcy-filings?tn=&pt=All&t=534&m%5Bvalue%5D%5Bmonth%5D=&y%5Bvalue%5D%5Byear%5D=2018
    - Select bankruptcy from the topic drop-down menu and the year that you want
    - Look for the link for "U.S. Bankruptcy Courts - Business and Nonbusiness Cases Filed, by Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, District, and County‚Äù
    - The PDF will give you a pretty view, but you need the csv file
    - Click on the link then download the CSV
    - Edit the CSV thus:
        - Copy the Circ/Dist and County column to column A
        - Copy the county code column into column B
        - Copy the total non business bankruptcies column to column C
        - Delete all other data
        - Unmerge all cells
        - Remove data from the top few columns (can accept any number of leading blank rows)

## Results

Taking into account (in order of predictive power) divorce(1), age(2), education(3), and insurance(4), with 2010 census data mixed with 2018 puma data and 2014 bankruptcy data, my model is able to predict bankrupcty rate of a PUMA on average to within .7 standard deviations (compared to .711 when predicting with just the mean), to within 95.3 people on average per 100,000 (vs 95.7), is 59% off from the true value on average (vs 60%), and out predicts the mean 50.5% of the time (R^2 - 0.022)
R^2:  0.022008745560812337
Mean error:  0.711865662994597
Prediction error:  [0.70899647]
1) Percent of a PUMA'S population that is currently divorced (rather than single, widowed, etc)
    - min: 3%
    - max: 22%
    - Higher divorce rate is correlated with higher bankruptcy (R^2 - .03)
2) Percent of a PUMA's population that is between the ages of 35 and 54
    - min: 6%
    - max: 30%
    - This rate is correlated with higher bankruptcy (R^2 - .035)
3) Percent of a PUMA's population that has just a high school degree of some college
    - min: 13%
    - max: 61%
    - This rate is correlated with higher bankruptcy (R^2 - .021)
4) Percent of a PUMA's population that has health insurance
    - min: 46%
    - max: 99%
    - This rate is inversely related with higher bankruptcy (R^2 - .001)
